## My name is Sam Hemingway
I'm a student at Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) studying Electrical Engineering. Currently, I'm a part of the 2025-26 Panther Lunabotics team as the Electrical team lead. I'm learning a ton about system design, and we're doing a lot of work with KiCad and utilizing GitHub to share out KiCad files. It's a lotta fun :)
